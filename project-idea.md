## 🧭 **PROJECT SUMMARY**

**Platform name (placeholder)**: *UniHub* (I’ll adjust later if I have a real name)
**Type**: A social + academic platform for University of Messina students.
**Core Idea**:

> UniHub is a free community platform where UniMe students can practice real exam-style problems, solve algorithmic challenges, take MCQs, create their own quizzes, share notes, and post anything — from study materials to socializing. It’s an open student-built ecosystem - “Not the official tool — the better one.”
>
> The platform’s mission is to make **exam prep less stressful, more social, and infinitely more practical**, with the help of shared questions, probable exam patterns, and peer collaboration.

**Tagline ideas:**

* “Practice smarter. Post freely. Learn socially.”
* “Real Unime questions, real community energy.”

## 🧑‍💻 **ABOUT US PAGE**

### Title:

> A platform made by UniMe students — for UniMe students.

### Section 1 — Our Story:

> UniHub started with two UniMe students who wanted an easier way to prepare for coding exams.
> Instead of isolated studying and scattered notes, they built a platform to centralize everything — tests, quizzes, and a social space where anyone could post, share, or ask for help without judgment.

### Section 2 — Our Mission:

> To make studying feel less lonely and more powerful.
> We’re creating a space where learning, collaboration, and community come together — because exams are temporary, but knowledge shared lasts.

### Section 3 — The Team:

> We’re a small two-person team:
>
> * **Founder & Backend Developer** — The mind behind the idea.
> * **Frontend Developer** — The hands behind the interface.
>
> Together, we’re building what we wish existed when we first came to UniMe.
